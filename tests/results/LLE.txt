Paw Lickin' Chicken is a big favorite with my cats. It's amazing stuff. Looks good enough to put on a crossiant!<br /><br />I use it in rotation with other Weruvas and other brands. When I first served this, my cats ate it like little crazies. Having seen the euphoria, I went out and bought more cans of PLC. I served it all the time and suddenly there was no interest. My epic fail. Too much, too often, equals wasted uneaten cans.<br /><br />I place Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken on reserve, serving it 2X total (breakfast and dinner) per week, due to the high cost hence one less star in my review.

The description kind of confused me, so I thought I was getting about twice as much. I misunderstood the 6-count boxes to mean that there were 6 packets (with 2 pastries each) per box, but there's only a total of 6 pastries/box. This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly.

This was purchased for my brother and his wife.  They rave about it.  This is a couple that is very discerning and quite hard to buy for.  I made a basket with unusual items and tasty treats and the balsamic was their favorite.

I've been drinking Twinings English Breakfast Tea for many years but just found out about its availability on Amazon. To get something that I was already using at a reduced price is terrific.

I am a guy so after using it it was not much better than the other brands, I gave to female friend. She is going to use it soon as her other bottles of shampoo is used. For me, it was same, softer feel maybe. I use the Salon brand like Paul Mitchell and buy a gallon of it and then pour into dispenser in the shower for use. This was good but I have short hair maybe that's why I don't notice the difference. For guys, the result is not significant compared to maybe a woman with long hair.

This is a great item! I love the silicon material. It is so easy to wash and dry! I don't have any problem with this item. What you see is what you get. I am planning to use to make some ice cubes after my kid graduate from eating baby foods :) Yes, it is expensive but the material is great and safe. I dont have any regret buying this item :)

I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.

I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!

I have been craving salt water taffy. After having my husband search around our city, we realized we could not find it anywhere. I used my trusty amazon account and found this seller. It came very quickly and tastes amazing!!!!! I almost made myself sick I ate so much! I will def buy this again! It's the perfect amount of chewy and its very smooth! Great flavors as well!

My dog loves these.  A little pricey, but can be broken into 2 or 3 smaller treats.  My boxer boy has a sensitive stomach, and these have never given him any "digestive" (read "gas" or "the runs") problems, although I limit him to just a third of a bone a day.  May not be the healthiest, as one reviewer said, but seems to make my dogs limited life happier.  Not to mention, most real bacon is loaded with salt, chemicals, and saturated fat...not too healthy either!
